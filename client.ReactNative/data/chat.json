      "response": {
        "response": "The speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 299,792 kilometers per second (186,282 miles per second). This fundamental constant, often denoted as 'c', plays a crucial role in physics, particularly in Einstein's theory of relativity. It represents the maximum speed at which information and energy can travel through space. The speed of light also influences time dilation, meaning that as objects approach this speed, time slows down relative to an outside observer.",

      "prompt": "How does photosynthesis work?",
      "response": {
        "response": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert sunlight into chemical energy. It occurs primarily in the chloroplasts of plant cells, where chlorophyll captures light energy to drive chemical reactions. These reactions transform carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. This process not only sustains the plants themselves but also produces the oxygen necessary for most life forms on Earth. Photosynthesis is fundamental to the global carbon cycle and plays a key role in maintaining atmospheric balance.",
