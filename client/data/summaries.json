            "summary": "Facing restrictions on its new AI features in China, Apple is reportedly seeking a partnership with a Chinese AI company. The move comes as Apple's ChatGPT-powered 'Apple Intelligence' features are incompatible with China's internet censorship policies. Apple has held talks with several Chinese tech giants, including Baidu and Alibaba, but no deal has been reached. Without a local AI partner, 'Apple Intelligence' features may remain unavailable in China, limiting the company's reach in a key market. Apple is already facing challenges in China, where local brands like Vivo and Xiaomi have already integrated AI features into their devices. Additionally, the new features will only be available on newer iPhone models and are not expected to support Chinese language until 2025. The delay and limited availability could hinder Apple's competitiveness in the Chinese smartphone market.",
